# BusIT week Brno 2019

A mobile app built for the BusIT week that took place in Brno, Czech Republic between 4 and 8 february 2019. During this week we saw the basics of android app development. The last day we worked on a location and QR-code based app, which you can find here. The contents of the 'engine' folder contains the location/GPS framework that we used (provided to us by the organizers).
